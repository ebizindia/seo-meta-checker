## Development Guidelines

### PHP Code Style

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

**Example:**
```php
/**
 * Normalize URL by adding protocol and removing fragments
 * 
 * @param string $url Raw URL input
 * @return string|false Normalized URL or false on failure
 */
private function normalizeUrl($url) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for memory efficiency
- Use appropriate data structures (hash maps for lookups)
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Consider scalability for large sites

### Security Best Practices

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate URLs and domains
- Prevent SSRF attacks
- Use prepared statements if adding database features
- Keep dependencies updated

## Testing

Currently, the tool uses manual testing. When contributing:

1. Test with various domain types:
   - Small sites (10-50 pages)
   - Medium sites (100-200 pages)
   - Large sites (500+ pages)

2. Test edge cases:
   - Invalid URLs
   - Domains with redirects
   - Sites with various HTML structures
   - Slow-responding websites

3. Test across browsers:
   - Chrome/Edge
   - Firefox
   - Safari

4. Test PHP versions:
   - PHP 8.0+
   - Different web servers (Apache, Nginx)

## Documentation

When adding features:

- Update README.md with new usage instructions
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md
- Include inline code comments
- Update configuration examples if needed
